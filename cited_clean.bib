                 selective refinements are some of the operations
                 supported by multiresolution technology. In this paper,
                 a general framework relying on the use of such
                 techniques applied to volume data rendering is
                 presented. Based on a pyramidal representation of data,
                 two aspects of our work are considered. First, the
                 decimation algorithm itself is described. The general
                 principle consists in gradually removing nodes of a
                 structural graph previously established while
                 respecting constraints. A second part introduces the
                 refinement of preliminary obtained Levels of Details
                 (LOD). The problem is to preserve as well as possible
                 the initial volume of studied objects. The goal is to
                 build an interactive system of visualization for the
                 analysis of volumetric data. The speed of treatments
                 associated with a good visualization should enable to
                 achieve a 3D survey of a natural object in a
                 quasi-interactive manner. The method has been
                 successfully applied to both synthetic and real data

  abstract =     "Naive discrete planes are well known to be functional
                 on a coordinate plane. The aim of our paper is to
                 extend the functionality concept to a larger family of
                 arithmetic discrete planes, by introducing suitable
                 projection directions ([alpha]1, [alpha]2, [alpha]3)
                 satisfying [alpha]1v1 + [alpha]2v2 + [alpha]3v3 = w.
                 Several applications are considered. We first study
                 certain local configurations, that is, the (m, n)-cubes
                 introduced in Ref. [J. Vittone, J.-M. Chassery,
                 (n,m)-cubes and Farey Nets for Naive Planes
                 Understanding, in: DGCI, 8th International Conference,

                 Springer-Verlag, 1999, pp. 76-87.]. We compute their
                 number for a given (m, n) and study their statistical
                 behaviour. We then apply functionality to formulate an
                 algorithm for generating arithmetic discrete planes,
                 inspired by Debled-Renesson [I. Debled-Renesson,

                 may be endowed with a combinatorial surface structure,
                 in the spirit of Ref. [Y. Kenmochi, A. Imiyam

                 For computational purposes a concrete mathematical
                 definition of features is required. In this paper we
                 use a topological approach, namely dynamical systems,
                 to define features of shapes. To exploit this
                 definition algorithmically we assume that a point
                 sample of the shape is given as input from which
                 features of the shape have to be approximated. We
                 translate our definition of features to the discrete
                 domain while mimicking the set-up developed for the
                 continuous shapes. Experimental results show that our
                 algorithms segment shapes in two and three dimensions
                 into so-called features quite effectively. Further, we
                 develop a shape matching algorithm that takes advantage
                 of our robust feature segmentation step.",

  abstract =     "Digital geometry is very different from Euclidean
                 geometry in many ways and the intersection of two
                 digital lines or planes is often used to illustrate
                 those differences. Nevertheless, while digital lines
                 and planes are widely studied in many areas, very few
                 works deal with the intersection of such objects. In
                 this paper, we investigate the geometrical and
                 arithmetical properties of those objects. More
                 precisely, we give some new results about the
                 connectivity, periodicity, and minimal parameters of
                 the intersection of two digital lines or planes.",

  abstract =     "A digital arc is called \&lsquo;straight\&rsquo; if it
                 is the digitization of a straight line segment. Since
                 the concept of digital straightness was introduced in
                 the mid-1970s, dozens of papers on the subject have
                 appeared; many characterizations of digital straight
                 lines have been formulated, and many algorithms for
                 determining whether a digital arc is straight have been
                 defined. This paper reviews the literature on digital
                 straightness and discusses its relationship to other
                 concepts of geometry, the theory of words, and number
                 theory.",

                 figure F of , in the discrete space , is a subset S of
                 whose Hausdorff distance to F is minimal ([rho] can be
                 considered as the resolution of the discrete space );
                 in particular such a discretization depends on the
                 choice of a metric on . This paper is a continuation of

                 have studied some properties of Hausdorff
                 discretizations of compact sets.In this paper, we study
                 the properties of Hausdorff discretization for metrics
                 induced by a norm and we refine this study for the
                 class of homogeneous metrics. We prove that for such
                 metrics the popular covering discretizations are
                 Hausdorff discretizations. We also compare the
                 Hausdorff discretization with the Bresenham
                 discretization (Bresenham, IBM Systems J. 4 (1) (1965)
                 25). Actually, we prove that the Bresenham
                 discretization of a straight line of is not always a
                 good discretization relatively to the Hausdorff metric.

                 properties of the Euclidean plane are translated in

                 discretization is 4-connected for homogeneous

                 continuous world by looking at a discrete
                 representation. Therefore, it is important to know
                 precisely which information is preserved during
                 digitization. We analyze this question in the context
                 of shape recognition. Existing results in this area are
                 based on very restricted models and thus not applicable
                 to real imaging situations. We present generalizations
                 in several directions: first, we introduce a new shape
                 similarity measure that approximates human perception
                 better. Second, we prove a geometric sampling theorem
                 for arbitrary dimensional spaces. Third, we extend our
                 sampling theorem to two-dimensional images that are
                 subjected to blurring by a disk point spread function.
                 Our findings are steps towards a general sampling

                 and many authors have investigated the computation of

                 methods are not systematized: calculations have to be
                 conducted manually for every mask size or image
                 anisotropy. Since image acquisition (e.g. medical
                 imaging) can lead to discrete anisotropic grids with
                 unpredictable anisotropy value, automated calculation
                 of chamfer mask coefficients becomes mandatory for e

                 an automatic construction for chamfer masks of
                 arbitrary sizes. This allows, first, to derive
                 analytically the relative error with respect to the

                 second, to compute optimal chamfer coefficients. In

                 representation for 3D shape based on a formal
                 derivation of the generic structure of its medial axis.
                 By classifying each skeletal point by its order of
                 contact, we show that, genetically, the medial axis
                 consists of five types of points, which are then
                 organized into sheets, curves, and points: 1) sheets
                 (manifolds with boundary) which are the locus of
                 bitangent spheres with regular tangency A/sub 1//sup 2/
                 (A/sub k//sup n/ notation means n distinct k-fold
                 tangencies of the sphere of contact, as explained in
                 the text); two types of curves, 2) the intersection
                 curve of three sheets and the locus of centers of
                 tritangent spheres, A/sub 1//sup 3/, and 3) the
                 boundary of sheets, which are the locus of centers of
                 spheres whose radius equals the larger principal
                 curvature, i.e., higher order contact A/sub 3/ points;
                 and two types of points, 4) centers of quad-tangent
                 spheres, A/sub 1//sup 4/, and 5) centers of spheres
                 with one regular tangency and one higher order
                 tangency, A/sub 1/A/sub 3/. The geometry of the 3D
                 medial axis thus consists of sheets (A/sub 1//sup 2/)
                 bounded by one type of curve (A/sub 3/) on their free
                 end, which corresponds to ridges on the surface, and
                 attached to two other sheets at another type of curve
                 (A/sub 1//sup 3/), which support a generalized cylinder
                 description. The A/sub 3/ curves can only end in A/sub
                 1/ A/sub 3/ points where they must meet an A/sub 1//sup
                 3/ curve. The A/sub 1//sup 3/ curves meet together in
                 fours at an A/sub 1//sup 4/ point. This formal result
                 leads to a compact representation for 3D shape,
                 referred to as the medial axis hypergraph
                 representation consisting of nodes (A/sub 1//sup 4/ and
                 A/sub 1/ A/sub 3/ points), links between pairs of nodes
                 (A/sub 1//sup 3/ and A/sub 3/ curves) and hyperlinks
                 between groups of links (A/sub 1//sup 2/ sheets). The
                 description of the local geometry at nodes by itself is
                 sufficient to capture qualitative aspects of shapes, in
                 analogy to 2D. We derive a pointwise reconstruction
                 formula to reconstruct a surface from this medial axis
                 hypergraph together with the radius function. Thus,
                 this information completely characterizes 3D shape and
                 lays the theoretical foundation for its use in
                 recognition, morphing, design, and man- ipulation of

                 approach for determining the skeleton of an object, is

                 maximal positive curvature and a distance map from each
                 of the segments is calculated. The skeleton is then
                 located by applying simple rules to the zero sets of
                 distance maps differences. A framework is proposed for
                 numerical approximation of distance maps that is
                 consistent with the continuous case, hence does not
                 suffer from digitization bias due to metrication errors
                 of the implementation on the grid. Subpixel accuracy in
                 distance map calculation is obtained by using gray
                 level information along the boundary of the shape in
                 the numerical scheme. The accuracy of the resulting
                 efficient skeletonization algorithm is demonstrated by
                 several examples. Keywords: Differential Geometry,

                 Author has mainly addressed the problem of 2-D shape
                 description and showed how a MAF (Medial Axis Function)
                 can be effectively used for the purpose. An MAF is
                 generated by locating the corners of intersection of
                 waves, which travel at constant speed in direction
                 normal to contour. MAF has many interesting properties
                 eg. stability, invariance and invertibility. MAF can be
                 used to infer about curvatures of parent contour. It is
                 shown that MAF can be utilized for pattern recognition
                 even in the presence of occlusion. Relation of MAF with
                 psychology and physiology are also indicated. Finally
                 author talks about an experimental system build for
                 getting MAF. On a whole, this paper seems to be a must
                 for understanding concepts of MAF. - RBA 7/94",
