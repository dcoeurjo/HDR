		 presented. Based on a pyramidal representation of data,
		 two aspects of our work are considered. First, the
		 decimation algorithm itself is described. The general
		 principle consists in gradually removing nodes of a
		 structural graph previously established while
		 respecting constraints. A second part introduces the
		 refinement of preliminary obtained Levels of Details
		 (LOD). The problem is to preserve as well as possible
		 the initial volume of studied objects. The goal is to
		 build an interactive system of visualization for the
		 analysis of volumetric data. The speed of treatments
		 associated with a good visualization should enable to
		 achieve a 3D survey of a natural object in a
		 quasi-interactive manner. The method has been
		 successfully applied to both synthetic and real data
		 (medical imaging).},

@ARTICLE{jamet_functionality,
  abstract = {Naive discrete planes are well known to be functional on a coordinate plane. The aim of our paper is to extend the functionality concept to a larger family of arithmetic discrete planes, by introducing suitable projection directions ([alpha]1, [alpha]2, [alpha]3) satisfying [alpha]1v1 + [alpha]2v2 + [alpha]3v3 = w. Several applications are considered. We first study certain local configurations, that is, the (m, n)-cubes introduced in Ref. [J. Vittone, J.-M. Chassery, (n,m)-cubes and Farey Nets for Naive Planes Understanding, in: DGCI, 8th International Conference, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, vol. 1568, Springer-Verlag, 1999, pp. 76-87.]. We compute their number for a given (m, n) and study their statistical behaviour. We then apply functionality to formulate an algorithm for generating arithmetic discrete planes, inspired by Debled-Renesson [I. Debled-Renesson, Reconnaissance des Droites et Plans Discrets, These de doctorat, Universite Louis Pasteur, Strasbourg, France, 1995.]. We also prove that an arithmetic discrete plane may be endowed with a combinatorial surface structure, in the spirit of Ref. [Y. Kenmochi, A. Imiyam Combinatorial topologies for discrete planes, in: DGCI, 11th International Conference, DGCI 2003, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, vol. 2886, Springer-Verlag, 2003, pp. 144-153.].},

  abstract = {Geometric shapes are identified with their features. For computational purposes a concrete mathematical definition of features is required. In this paper we use a topological approach, namely dynamical systems, to define features of shapes. To exploit this definition algorithmically we assume that a point sample of the shape is given as input from which features of the shape have to be approximated. We translate our definition of features to the discrete domain while mimicking the set-up developed for the continuous shapes. Experimental results show that our algorithms segment shapes in two and three dimensions into so-called features quite effectively. Further, we develop a shape matching algorithm that takes advantage of our robust feature segmentation step.},

This paper is a continuation of our works (Ronse and Tajine, J. Math. Imaging Vision 12 (3) (2000) 219; Hausdorff discretization for cellular distances, and its relation to cover and supercover discretization (to be revised for JVCIR), 2000, Wagner et al., An Approach to Discretization Based on the Hausdorff Metric. I. ISMM'98, Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, 1998, pp. 67-74), in which we have studied some properties of Hausdorff discretizations of compact sets.In this paper, we study the properties of Hausdorff discretization for metrics induced by a norm and we refine this study for the class of homogeneous metrics. We prove that for such metrics the popular covering discretizations are Hausdorff discretizations. We also compare the Hausdorff discretization with the Bresenham discretization (Bresenham, IBM Systems J. 4 (1) (1965) 25). Actually, we prove that the Bresenham discretization of a straight line of  is not always a good discretization relatively to the Hausdorff metric. This result is an extension of Tajine et al. (Hausdorff Discretization and its Comparison with other Discretization Schemes, DGCI'99, Paris, Lecture Notes in Computer Sciences Vol. 1568, Springer, Berlin, 1999, pp. 399-410), in which we prove the same result for a segment of . Finally, we study how some topological properties of the Euclidean plane  are translated in discrete space for Hausdorff discretizations. Actually, we prove that a Hausdorff discretization of a connected closed set is 8-connected and its maximal Hausdorff discretization is 4-connected for homogeneous metrics.},

Therefore, it is important to know precisely which information is preserved during digitization. We analyze this question in the context of shape recognition. Existing results in this area are based on very restricted models and thus not applicable to real imaging situations. We present generalizations in several directions: first, we introduce a new shape similarity measure that approximates human perception better. Second, we prove a geometric sampling theorem for arbitrary dimensional spaces. Third, we extend our sampling theorem to two-dimensional images that are subjected to blurring by a disk point spread function. Our findings are steps towards a general sampling theory for shapes that shall ultimately describe the behavior of real optical systems.},

Unfortunately, these methods are not systematized: calculations have to be conducted manually for every mask size or image anisotropy. Since image acquisition (e.g. medical imaging) can lead to discrete anisotropic grids with unpredictable anisotropy value, automated calculation of chamfer mask coefficients becomes mandatory for e cient distance map computations. This article presents an automatic construction for chamfer masks of arbitrary sizes. This allows, first, to derive analytically the relative error with respect to the Euclidean distance, in any 3-D anisotropic lattice, and second, to compute optimal chamfer coefficients. In addition, the resulting chamfer map verifies discrete norm conditions.}

  abstract = {This paper proposes a novel hypergraph skeletal representation for 3D shape based on a formal derivation of the generic structure of its medial axis. By classifying each skeletal point by its order of contact, we show that, genetically, the medial axis consists of five types of points, which are then organized into sheets, curves, and points: 1) sheets (manifolds with boundary) which are the locus of bitangent spheres with regular tangency A/sub 1//sup 2/ (A/sub k//sup n/ notation means n distinct k-fold tangencies of the sphere of contact, as explained in the text); two types of curves, 2) the intersection curve of three sheets and the locus of centers of tritangent spheres, A/sub 1//sup 3/, and 3) the boundary of sheets, which are the locus of centers of spheres whose radius equals the larger principal curvature, i.e., higher order contact A/sub 3/ points; and two types of points, 4) centers of quad-tangent spheres, A/sub 1//sup 4/, and 5) centers of spheres with one regular tangency and one higher order tangency, A/sub 1/A/sub 3/. The geometry of the 3D medial axis thus consists of sheets (A/sub 1//sup 2/) bounded by one type of curve (A/sub 3/) on their free end, which corresponds to ridges on the surface, and attached to two other sheets at another type of curve (A/sub 1//sup 3/), which support a generalized cylinder description. The A/sub 3/ curves can only end in A/sub 1/ A/sub 3/ points where they must meet an A/sub 1//sup 3/ curve. The A/sub 1//sup 3/ curves meet together in fours at an A/sub 1//sup 4/ point. This formal result leads to a compact representation for 3D shape, referred to as the medial axis hypergraph representation consisting of nodes (A/sub 1//sup 4/ and A/sub 1/ A/sub 3/ points), links between pairs of nodes (A/sub 1//sup 3/ and A/sub 3/ curves) and hyperlinks between groups of links (A/sub 1//sup 2/ sheets). The description of the local geometry at nodes by itself is sufficient to capture qualitative aspects of shapes, in analogy to 2D. We derive a pointwise reconstruction formula to reconstruct a surface from this medial axis hypergraph together with the radius function. Thus, this information completely characterizes 3D shape and lays the theoretical foundation for its use in recognition, morphing, design, and man- ipulation of shapes.},

		 numerical approximation of distance maps that is
		 consistent with the continuous case, hence does not
		 suffer from digitization bias due to metrication errors
		 of the implementation on the grid. Subpixel accuracy in

		 level information along the boundary of the shape in
		 the numerical scheme. The accuracy of the resulting

                 of Medial Axis Transform (MAT) for shape description.
                 Author has mainly addressed the problem of 2-D shape
                 description and showed how a MAF (Medial Axis Function)
                 can be effectively used for the purpose. An MAF is
                 generated by locating the corners of intersection of
                 waves, which travel at constant speed in direction
                 normal to contour. MAF has many interesting properties
                 eg. stability, invariance and invertibility. MAF can be
                 used to infer about curvatures of parent contour. It is
                 shown that MAF can be utilized for pattern recognition
                 even in the presence of occlusion. Relation of MAF with
                 psychology and physiology are also indicated. Finally
                 author talks about an experimental system build for
                 getting MAF. On a whole, this paper seems to be a must
                 for understanding concepts of MAF. - RBA 7/94}
