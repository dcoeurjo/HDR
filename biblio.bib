		 selective refinements are some of the operations
		 supported by multiresolution technology. In this paper,
		 a general framework relying on the use of such
		 techniques applied to volume data rendering is
		 presented. Based on a pyramidal representation of data,
		 two aspects of our work are considered. First, the
		 decimation algorithm itself is described. The general
		 principle consists in gradually removing nodes of a
		 structural graph previously established while
		 respecting constraints. A second part introduces the
		 refinement of preliminary obtained Levels of Details
		 (LOD). The problem is to preserve as well as possible
		 the initial volume of studied objects. The goal is to
		 build an interactive system of visualization for the
		 analysis of volumetric data. The speed of treatments
		 associated with a good visualization should enable to
		 achieve a 3D survey of a natural object in a
		 quasi-interactive manner. The method has been
		 successfully applied to both synthetic and real data
		 (medical imaging).",

@article{jamet_functionality,
	abstract = {Naive discrete planes are well known to be functional on a coordinate plane. The aim of our paper is to extend the functionality concept to a larger family of arithmetic discrete planes, by introducing suitable projection directions ([alpha]1, [alpha]2, [alpha]3) satisfying [alpha]1v1 + [alpha]2v2 + [alpha]3v3 = w. Several applications are considered. We first study certain local configurations, that is, the (m, n)-cubes introduced in Ref. [J. Vittone, J.-M. Chassery, (n,m)-cubes and Farey Nets for Naive Planes Understanding, in: DGCI, 8th International Conference, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, vol. 1568, Springer-Verlag, 1999, pp. 76-87.]. We compute their number for a given (m, n) and study their statistical behaviour. We then apply functionality to formulate an algorithm for generating arithmetic discrete planes, inspired by Debled-Renesson [I. Debled-Renesson, Reconnaissance des Droites et Plans Discrets, These de doctorat, Universite Louis Pasteur, Strasbourg, France, 1995.]. We also prove that an arithmetic discrete plane may be endowed with a combinatorial surface structure, in the spirit of Ref. [Y. Kenmochi, A. Imiyam Combinatorial topologies for discrete planes, in: DGCI, 11th International Conference, DGCI 2003, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, vol. 2886, Springer-Verlag, 2003, pp. 144-153.].},

In this paper we use a topological approach, namely dynamical systems, to define features of shapes. To exploit this definition algorithmically we assume that a point sample of the shape is given as input from which features of the shape have to be approximated. We translate our definition of features to the discrete domain while mimicking the set-up developed for the continuous shapes. Experimental results show that our algorithms segment shapes in two and three dimensions into so-called features quite effectively. Further, we develop a shape matching algorithm that takes advantage of our robust feature segmentation step.},

                 Other Hough algorithms are intended to detect straight
                 lines in the analog pre-image. These approaches are
                 analyzed and compared in terms of the relation between
                 the achievable resolution and the required number of
                 accumulators, using a definition of resolution that is
                 based on the Geometric Probability measure of straight
                 lines. It is shown that the `analog' approach is
                 greatly superior in high resolution applications, where
                 a `digital' Hough Transform would generally require an
                 infeasibly large number of accumulators.",

                 circles, rings, and an immediate extension to spheres.
                 The circle, called arithmetical circle is defined by
                 diophantine equations. The integer radius circles with
                 the same centre pave the plane. It is easy to determine
                 if a point is on, inside, or outside a circle. This was
                 not easy to do with previous definitions of circles,
                 like Bresenham's. We show that the arithmetical circle
                 extends Bresenham's circle. We give an efficient
                 incremental generation algorithm. The arithmetical
                 circle has many extensions. We present briefly
                 half-integer centered circles with a generation
                 algorithm, 4-connected circles, and a general ring
                 definition. We finish with the arithmetical sphere, an
                 immediate 3D extension of arithmetical circle. We give
                 elements to build a algorithm for generating the

                 threshold-based methods such as hierarchical clustering
                 are often used. The line segments comprising a straight

                 methods have difficulty clustering such line segments.
                 A new cluster extraction method is proposed to cope
                 with this problem. This method extracts fuzzy clusters

                 nature of a computer screen makes this operation rather
                 difficult. I propose to discretize real affine
                 applications in order to obtain quasi-affine
                 transformations which are similar to the calculus of
                 real applications in fixed point arithmetic. Until now,
                 the computer graphists avoided this digitization,
                 replacing it by other methods (inverse mapping,
                 over-sampling) which require heavy calculation. I

  abstract =     "We introduce the notion of the medial scaffold, a
                 hierarchical organization of the medial axis of a 3D
                 shape in the form of a graph constructed from special
                 medial curves connecting special medial points. A key
                 advantage of the scaffold is that it captures the
                 qualitative aspects of shape in a hierarchical and
                 tightly condensed representation. We propose an
                 efficient and exact method for computing the medial
                 scaffold based on a notion of propagation along the
                 scaffold itself, starting from initial sources of the
                 flow and constructing the scaffold during the
                 propagation. We examine this method specifically in the
                 context of an unorganized cloud of points in 3D, e.g.,
                 as obtained from laser range finders, which typically
                 involve hundreds of thousands of points, but the ideas
                 are generalizable to data arising from geometrically
                 described surface patches. The computational bottleneck
                 in the propagation-based scheme is in finding the
                 initial sources of the flow. We thus present several
                 ideas to avoid the unnecessary consideration of pairs
                 of points which cannot possibly form a medial point
                 source, such as the {"}visibility¿ of a point from
                 another given a third point and the interaction of
                 clusters of points. An application of using the medial

                 set covering problem (USCP) is to determine the
                 smallest possible subset of F that also covers E. We
                 study in this paper a variant, called the Large Set
                 Covering Problem (LSCP), which differs from the USCP in
                 that E and the subsets Ei are not given in extension
                 because they are very large sets that are possibly
                 infinite. We propose three exact algorithms for solving
                 the LSCP. Two of them determine minimal covers, while
                 the third one produces minimum covers. Heuristic
                 versions of these algorithms are also proposed and

                 description and showed how a MAF (Medial Axis Function)
                 can be effectively used for the purpose. An MAF is

                 normal to contour. MAF has many interesting properties
                 eg. stability, invariance and invertibility. MAF can be
                 used to infer about curvatures of parent contour. It is
                 shown that MAF can be utilized for pattern recognition

                 have studied some properties of Hausdorff
                 discretizations of compact sets.In this paper, we study
                 the properties of Hausdorff discretization for metrics
                 induced by a norm and we refine this study for the
                 class of homogeneous metrics. We prove that for such
                 metrics the popular covering discretizations are
                 Hausdorff discretizations. We also compare the
                 Hausdorff discretization with the Bresenham
                 discretization (Bresenham, IBM Systems J. 4 (1) (1965)
                 25). Actually, we prove that the Bresenham
                 discretization of a straight line of is not always a
                 good discretization relatively to the Hausdorff metric.

                 moments because of their special properties of image
                 reconstruction and immunity to noise, suffer from
                 several discretization errors. These errors lead to
                 poor quality of reconstructed image and wide variations
                 in the numerical values of the moments. The predominant
                 factor, as observed in this paper, is due to the
                 discrete integer implementation of the steps involved
                 in moment calculation. It is shown in this paper that
                 by modifying the algorithms to include discrete float
                 implementation, the quality of the reconstructed image
                 improves significantly and the first-order moment
                 becomes zero. Low-order Zernike moments have been found
                 to be stable under linear transformations while the
                 high-order moments have large variations. The large
                 variations in high-order moments, however, do not
                 greatly affect the quality of the reconstructed image,
                 implying that they should be ignored when numerical
                 values of moments are used as features. The 11
                 functions based on geometric moments have also been
                 found to be stable under linear transformations and
                 thus these can be used as features. Pixel level

                 determination; however, their computation is too
                 expensive, which limits the application of GMs. In this

                 short 3-D moments) are important features for 3-D
                 object recognition and shape description. To calculate
                 the moments of objects in a 3-D image by a
                 straightforward method requires a large number of
                 computing operations. Some authors have proposed fast
                 algorithms to compute the 3-D moments. However, the
                 problem of computation has not been well solved since
                 all known methods require computations of orderN3,
                 assuming that the object is represented by anNxNxNvoxel
                 image. In this paper, we present a discrete divergence
                 theorem which can be used to compute the sum of a
                 function over ann-dimensional discrete region by a
                 summation over the discrete surface enclosing the
                 region. As its corollaries, we give a discrete Gauss's
                 theorem for 3-D discrete objects and a discrete Green's
                 theorem for 2-D discrete objects. Using a fast surface
                 tracking algorithm and the discrete Gauss's theorem, we
                 design a new method to compute the geometric moments of
                 3-D binary objects as observed in 3-D discrete images.
                 This method reduces the computational complexity
                 significantly, requiring computation ofO(N2). This

                 and hence the book is well suited for students in
                 computer science and engineering. Motivation is
                 provided from the application areas: all solutions and
                 techniques from computational geometry are related to
                 particular applications in robotics, graphics, CAD/CAM,
                 and geographic information systems. For students this
                 motivation will be especially welcome. Modern insights
                 in computational geometry are used to provide solutions
                 that are both efficient and easy to understand and
                 implement. All the basic techniques and topics from
                 computational geometry, as well as several more
                 advanced topics, are covered. The book is largely

                 existing algorithms do not provide an accurate
                 determination of the normal vector field for shapes
                 that present edges. Here, we propose a new and simple
                 computational method in order to obtain accurate
                 results on all types of shapes, whatever their local
                 convexity degree. The presented method is based on the
                 gradient vector field analysis of the object distance
                 map. This vector field is adaptively filtered around
                 each surface voxel using angle and symmetry criteria so
                 that as many relevant contributions as possible are
                 accounted for. This optimizes the smoothing of

                 generalizations of the ART to describe two-dimensional

                 properties that the original transform: robustness to

                 theoretical interests. Concerning the digital
                 straightness in dimension 2, many digital straight line
                 characterizations exist and the digital straight
                 segment preimage is well known. In this article, we
                 investigate the preimage associated to digital planes.
                 More precisely, we present structure theorems that
                 describe the preimage of a digital plane. Furthermore,
                 we present a bound on the number...",
