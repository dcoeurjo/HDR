                 description and showed how a MAF (Medial Axis Function)
                 can be effectively used for the purpose. An MAF is
                 generated by locating the corners of intersection of
                 waves, which travel at constant speed in direction
                 normal to contour. MAF has many interesting properties
                 eg. stability, invariance and invertibility. MAF can be
                 used to infer about curvatures of parent contour. It is
                 shown that MAF can be utilized for pattern recognition
                 even in the presence of occlusion. Relation of MAF with
                 psychology and physiology are also indicated. Finally
                 author talks about an experimental system build for
                 getting MAF. On a whole, this paper seems to be a must
                 for understanding concepts of MAF. - RBA 7/94"

                 segment. That fundamental result has found many

                 description and showed how a MAF (Medial Axis Function)
                 can be effectively used for the purpose. An MAF is
                 generated by locating the corners of intersection of
                 waves, which travel at constant speed in direction
                 normal to contour. MAF has many interesting properties
                 eg. stability, invariance and invertibility. MAF can be
                 used to infer about curvatures of parent contour. It is
                 shown that MAF can be utilized for pattern recognition
                 even in the presence of occlusion. Relation of MAF with
                 psychology and physiology are also indicated. Finally
                 author talks about an experimental system build for
                 getting MAF. On a whole, this paper seems to be a must

ABSTRACT = {Chamfer distances are widely used in image analysis and many authors have investigated the computation of optimal chamfer mask coefficients. Unfortunately, these methods are not systematized: calculations have to be conducted manually for every mask size or image anisotropy. Since image acquisition (e.g. medical imaging) can lead to discrete anisotropic grids with unpredictable anisotropy value, automated calculation of chamfer mask coefficients becomes mandatory for e cient distance map computations. This article presents an automatic construction for chamfer masks of arbitrary sizes. This allows, first, to derive analytically the relative error with respect to the Euclidean distance, in any 3-D anisotropic lattice, and second, to compute optimal chamfer coefficients. In addition, the resulting chamfer map verifies discrete norm conditions.}

@article{citeulike:677854,
	abstract = {This paper proposes a novel hypergraph skeletal representation for 3D shape based on a formal derivation of the generic structure of its medial axis. By classifying each skeletal point by its order of contact, we show that, genetically, the medial axis consists of five types of points, which are then organized into sheets, curves, and points: 1) sheets (manifolds with boundary) which are the locus of bitangent spheres with regular tangency A/sub 1//sup 2/ (A/sub k//sup n/ notation means n distinct k-fold tangencies of the sphere of contact, as explained in the text); two types of curves, 2) the intersection curve of three sheets and the locus of centers of tritangent spheres, A/sub 1//sup 3/, and 3) the boundary of sheets, which are the locus of centers of spheres whose radius equals the larger principal curvature, i.e., higher order contact A/sub 3/ points; and two types of points, 4) centers of quad-tangent spheres, A/sub 1//sup 4/, and 5) centers of spheres with one regular tangency and one higher order tangency, A/sub 1/A/sub 3/. The geometry of the 3D medial axis thus consists of sheets (A/sub 1//sup 2/) bounded by one type of curve (A/sub 3/) on their free end, which corresponds to ridges on the surface, and attached to two other sheets at another type of curve (A/sub 1//sup 3/), which support a generalized cylinder description. The A/sub 3/ curves can only end in A/sub 1/ A/sub 3/ points where they must meet an A/sub 1//sup 3/ curve. The A/sub 1//sup 3/ curves meet together in fours at an A/sub 1//sup 4/ point. This formal result leads to a compact representation for 3D shape, referred to as the medial axis hypergraph representation consisting of nodes (A/sub 1//sup 4/ and A/sub 1/ A/sub 3/ points), links between pairs of nodes (A/sub 1//sup 3/ and A/sub 3/ curves) and hyperlinks between groups of links (A/sub 1//sup 2/ sheets). The description of the local geometry at nodes by itself is sufficient to capture qualitative aspects of shapes, in analogy to 2D. We derive a pointwise reconstruction formula to reconstruct a surface from this medial axis hypergraph together with the radius function. Thus, this information completely characterizes 3D shape and lays the theoretical foundation for its use in recognition, morphing, design, and man- ipulation of shapes.},

  abstract =	"The medial axis transform (MAT) of a shape, better
		 known as its skeleton, is frequently used in shape
		 analysis and related areas. In this paper a new
		 approach for determining the skeleton of an object, is
		 presented. The boundary is segmented at points of
		 maximal positive curvature and a distance map from each
		 of the segments is calculated. The skeleton is then
		 located by applying simple rules to the zero sets of
		 distance maps differences. A framework is proposed for
		 numerical approximation of distance maps that is
		 consistent with the continuous case, hence does not
		 suffer from digitization bias due to metrication errors
		 of the implementation on the grid. Subpixel accuracy in
		 distance map calculation is obtained by using gray
		 level information along the boundary of the shape in
		 the numerical scheme. The accuracy of the resulting
		 efficient skeletonization algorithm is demonstrated by
		 several examples. Keywords: Differential Geometry,

                 Author has mainly addressed the problem of 2-D shape
                 description and showed how a MAF (Medial Axis Function)
                 can be effectively used for the purpose. An MAF is
                 generated by locating the corners of intersection of
                 waves, which travel at constant speed in direction
                 normal to contour. MAF has many interesting properties
                 eg. stability, invariance and invertibility. MAF can be
                 used to infer about curvatures of parent contour. It is
                 shown that MAF can be utilized for pattern recognition
                 even in the presence of occlusion. Relation of MAF with
                 psychology and physiology are also indicated. Finally
                 author talks about an experimental system build for
                 getting MAF. On a whole, this paper seems to be a must
                 for understanding concepts of MAF. - RBA 7/94"
