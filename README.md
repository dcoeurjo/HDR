## Abstract

The context of the work presented in this thesis is the digital
geometry. This research area is devoted to the automatic analysis of
objects in digital images in dimension 2 and 3. All acquisition
devices provide data organized on regular grids, called digital
data. The algorithms that are explored and extended keep the discrete
aspect of the data, in opposition to techniques based on an
approximation process of a continuous model. More precisely, we are
interested in the study of digital curves and surfaces. First of all,
we consider basic digital objects such as digital straight lines,
planes and circles. We present algorithms that allow to characterize
such objects and we propose some extensions of these methods. Then, we
study some metrics on the digital objects such as the Euclidean
distance transform and the notion of digital geodesic. An approach
based on the visibility property in digital domains is presented. In
the third part, we define and evaluate estimators of the Euclidean
measurements such as the length, the curvature or the area. Some
results on the convergence of these estimators are presented. Finally,
we illustrate some applications in which these researches have been
used for: archaeological object automatic classification and snow
sample micro-structure analysis.
