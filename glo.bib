A relative storage scheme is employed thast permits reconstruction of region occupancy information during the search for digital line support. Furthermore, it is shown that all values in the AHT data structure may be stored as rational numbers with fixed and finite numerator and denominator ranges defined by the image resolution. As a result, all floating point computations are replaced by faster, fixed word-size, integer operations.},

The integer radius circles with the same centre pave the plane. It is easy to determine if a point is on, inside, or outside a circle. This was not easy to do with previous definitions of circles, like Bresenham{'}s. We show that the arithmetical circle extends Bresenham{'}s circle. We give an efficient incremental generation algorithm. The arithmetical circle has many extensions. We present briefly half-integer centered circles with a generation algorithm, 4-connected circles, and a general ring definition. We finish with the arithmetical sphere, an immediate 3D extension of arithmetical circle. We give elements to build a algorithm for generating the sphere.},

I propose to discretize real affine applications in order to obtain quasi-affine transformations which are similar to the calculus of real applications in fixed point arithmetic. Until now, the computer graphists avoided this digitization, replacing it by other methods (inverse mapping, over-sampling) which require heavy calculation. I present an algorithm for the determination of reciprocal images of a point by a quasi-affine transformation; this algorithm will permit the transformation of digitized images by discrete affine applications. In general, a one-to-one mapping is not obtained, but it is possible to determine where the points are without antecedent or those with more than one antecedent. In addition if the affine application is sufficiently dilating, the associated discrete transformation is inversible. The algorithm I propose uses integer arithmetic with only tests and additions (no multiplication nor division) so that it can be quickly performed.},

We propose an efficient and exact method for computing the medial scaffold based on a notion of propagation along the scaffold itself, starting from initial sources of the flow and constructing the scaffold during the propagation. We examine this method specifically in the context of an unorganized cloud of points in 3D, e.g., as obtained from laser range finders, which typically involve hundreds of thousands of points, but the ideas are generalizable to data arising from geometrically described surface patches. The computational bottleneck in the propagation-based scheme is in finding the initial sources of the flow. We thus present several ideas to avoid the unnecessary consideration of pairs of points which cannot possibly form a medial point source, such as the {"}visibility{?'}ofapointfromanothergivenathirdpointandtheinteractionofclustersofpoints.Anapplicationofusingthemedialscaffoldfortherepresentationofpointsamplingsofreal-lifeobjectsisalsoillustrated.", author =       "F.F.LeymarieandB.B.Kimia", citeulike-article-id = "1023183", journal =      "PatternAnalysisandMachineIntelligence},

	Abstract = {Given a finite set E and a family F=E1,...,Em of subsets of E such that F covers E, the famous unicost set covering problem (USCP) is to determine the smallest possible subset of F that also covers E. We study in this paper a variant, called the Large Set Covering Problem (LSCP), which differs from the USCP in that E and the subsets Ei are not given in extension because they are very large sets that are possibly infinite. We propose three exact algorithms for solving the LSCP. Two of them determine minimal covers, while the third one produces minimum covers. Heuristic versions of these algorithms are also proposed and analysed. We then give several procedures for the computation of a lower bound on the minimum size of a cover. We finally present algorithms for finding the largest possible subset of F that does not cover E. We also show that a particular case of the LSCP is to determine irreducible infeasible sets in inconsistent constraint satisfaction problems. All concepts presented in the paper are illustrated on the k-colouring problem which is formulated as a constraint satisfaction problem.},

We prove that for such metrics the popular covering discretizations are Hausdorff discretizations.

Selection of a feature extraction method is probably the single most important factor in achieving high recognition performance in character recognition systems. Different feature extraction methods are designed for different representations of the characters, such as solid binary characters, character contours, skeletons (thinned characters) or gray-level subimages of each individual character. The feature extraction methods are discussed in terms of invariance properties, reconstructability and expected distortions and variability of the characters. The problem of choosing the appropriate feature extraction method for a given application is also discussed. When a few promising feature extraction methods have been identified, they need to be evaluated experimentally to find the best method for the given application.},

	Abstract = {Zernike moments which are superior to geometric moments because of their special properties of image reconstruction and immunity to noise, suffer from several discretization errors. These errors lead to poor quality of reconstructed image and wide variations in the numerical values of the moments. The predominant factor, as observed in this paper, is due to the discrete integer implementation of the steps involved in moment calculation. It is shown in this paper that by modifying the algorithms to include discrete float implementation, the quality of the reconstructed image improves significantly and the first-order moment becomes zero. Low-order Zernike moments have been found to be stable under linear transformations while the high-order moments have large variations. The large variations in high-order moments, however, do not greatly affect the quality of the reconstructed image, implying that they should be ignored when numerical values of moments are used as features. The 11 functions based on geometric moments have also been found to be stable under linear transformations and thus these can be used as features. Pixel level analysis of the images has been carried out to strengthen the results.},

Firstly, the pixel-based calculation of GMs is converted into the line-segment-based calculation, then a new approach is proposed to calculate the line-segment integrals. After line-segment integrals are calculated, Hatamian{'}s filter method is introduced to calculate GMs, which further simplifies the moment calculation. Finally, this method is compared with the known results, which show that our method can calculate any complicated object moments, and also efficiently reduces both addition and multiplication complexity.},

	Abstract = {The three-dimensional Cartesian geometric moments (for short 3-D moments) are important features for 3-D object recognition and shape description. To calculate the moments of objects in a 3-D image by a straightforward method requires a large number of computing operations. Some authors have proposed fast algorithms to compute the 3-D moments. However, the problem of computation has not been well solved since all known methods require computations of orderN3, assuming that the object is represented by anNxNxNvoxel image. In this paper, we present a discrete divergence theorem which can be used to compute the sum of a function over ann-dimensional discrete region by a summation over the discrete surface enclosing the region. As its corollaries, we give a discrete Gauss{'}s theorem for 3-D discrete objects and a discrete Green{'}s theorem for 2-D discrete objects. Using a fast surface tracking algorithm and the discrete Gauss{'}s theorem, we design a new method to compute the geometric moments of 3-D binary objects as observed in 3-D discrete images. This method reduces the computational complexity significantly, requiring computation ofO(N2). This reduction is demonstrated experimentally on two 3-D objects. We also generalize the method to deal with high-dimensional images. Some 3-D moment invariants and shape features are also discussed.},

Second, we prove a geometric sampling theorem for arbitrary dimensional spaces. Third, we extend our sampling theorem to two-dimensional images that are subjected to blurring by a disk point spread function.

	Abstract = {Medial Axis (MA), also known as Centres of Maximal Disks, is a useful representation of a shape for image description and analysis. MA can be computed on a distance transform, where each point is labelled to its distance to the background. Recent algorithms allow one to compute Squared Euclidean Distance Transform (SEDT) in linear time in any dimension. While these algorithms provide exact measures, the only known method to characterise MA on SEDT, using local tests and Look-Up Tables (LUT), is limited to 2D and small distance values [Borgefors, et al., Seventh Scandinavian Conference on Image Analysis, 1991]. We have proposed [Remy, et al., Pat. Rec. Lett. 23 (2002) 649] an algorithm which computes the LUT and the neighbourhood to be tested in the case of chamfer distances. In this article, we adapt our algorithm for SEDT in arbitrary dimension and show that results have completely different properties.},

	Abstract = {Estimating the normal vector field on the boundary of discrete three-dimensional objects is essential for rendering and image measurement problems. Most of the existing algorithms do not provide an accurate determination of the normal vector field for shapes that present edges. Here, we propose a new and simple computational method in order to obtain accurate results on all types of shapes, whatever their local convexity degree. The presented method is based on the gradient vector field analysis of the object distance map. This vector field is adaptively filtered around each surface voxel using angle and symmetry criteria so that as many relevant contributions as possible are accounted for. This optimizes the smoothing of digitization effects while preserving relevant details of the processed numerical object. Thanks to the precise normal field obtained, a projection method can be proposed to immediately derive the surface area from a raw discrete object. An empirical justification of the validity of such an algorithm in the continuous limit is also provided. Some results on simulated data and snow images from X-ray tomography are presented, compared to the Marching Cubes and Convex Hull results, and discussed.},

	Abstract = {The angular radial transform (ART) is a moment-based image description method adopted in MPEG-7 as a 2D region-based shape descriptor. This paper proposes generalizations of the ART to describe two-dimensional images and three-dimensional models. First, we propose an 2D extension, called GART, which allows applying ART to images while insuring robustness to all possible rotations and to perspective deformations. Then, we generalize the ART to index 3D models. This new 3D shape descriptor, so called 3D ART, has the same properties that the original transform: robustness to rotation, translation, noise and scaling while keeping a compact size and a good retrieval cost. The size of the descriptor is an essential evaluation parameter on which depends the response time of a content-based retrieval system. For both generalizations, many experiments were made on large databases and have shown, that GART outperforms ART in accuracy at the cost of speed, and that 3D ART outperforms the spherical harmonics shape descriptor (Vranic, D.V., Saupe, D., 2002.
